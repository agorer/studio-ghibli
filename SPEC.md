- The task is to write a Python Django application which serves a page on localhost:8000/movies/
- This page should contain a plain list of all movies from the [Ghibli API](https://ghibliapi.herokuapp.com/)
- For each movie the people that appear in it should be listed
- Since accessing the API is a time-intensive operation, it should not happen on every page load
  * Make sure that the information on the page is not older than 1 minute when the page is loaded
- Format the code according to the PEP8 conventions
